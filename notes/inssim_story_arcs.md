## Tactical Campaign 2 
    [ Passive Ops ] Investigate Location {Day}
        A recent bombing just outside of the city center left behind a lot of evidence. Make sure the forensics team is kept safe.
    [ Passive Ops ] Gather Intel {Night}
        While the explosive-residue experts run their tests, follow up on the two evidential leads.
    [ Covert Ops  ] Recruit Source {Night}
        Investigation led to a possible sympathetic source that has influence and valuable intel. Make contact with the prospective asset.
    [ Passive Ops ] Gather Intel {Day}
        Intel asset is willing to cooperate fully. Follow up on the leads he has described. 
    [ Covert Ops  ] Train Local Forces {Day}
        3 of the several leads appear most promising. Special intelligence assets will further evaluate them.
        In the meantime, local assets have opened up, and require training for future operations in the region.
    [ Covert Ops  ] Surveil Target {Night}
        One lead has indicated a likely target that may reveal opfor assets in the region. Tail him to reveal these locations.
    [Direct Action] Raid Location {Night}
        The target's phone revealed a consistent incoming call location. Thermal recon drone's monitoring has confirmed opfor compound. Civilian proximity prohibits airstrikes. Clear it out.
    [ Covert Ops  ] Gather Intel {Day}
        Local asset's previous lead has been corroborated with acquired intel monitor the location for necessary intel.
    * [Direct Action] Raid Location {Night}
        Raid has been greenlit. Move local assets out of the area before conducting raid.

        Reclaimed informant has given up a large covert opfor compound. The location is suspected to be a network command center. Surveilance will get to work on monitoring the location and acquiring actionable intel.
        Kick the hornet's nest so we can see how they react.
    [ Passive Ops ] Recruit Local Forces {Night}
        Once the opfor is removed from the region, due to immense corruption, there will be a significant power vacuum. To avoid further destruction and chaos, there must be a friendly force ready to assume control. Facillitate recruitment of friendly militia forces.
    [Direct Action] QRF {Night}
        The militia has been engaged by opfor forces. Fix them.
