World Generation:

    Generate Factions
        heirarchies

            originator node - could be highest, lowest, or middle node
                heirarchy can be generated based on this originator, by expanding up and/or down based on size of organization (can't go up/down far in a small heirarchy)

            by size
                startup/crew/small-family           1-6 (1 leader, 1/2 manager, 3/4 workers)
                small-company/gang/large-family     5-12 (1 leader, 2-3 manager, )




                family (each pair of parents generates 1-4 children)
                company 


        groups have chance to be:
            business / company




    Generate Locations

            root location node
                .33% for 2-6 sub-locations
            generate 1-6 adjacent locations

        individual location can generate
            individual
