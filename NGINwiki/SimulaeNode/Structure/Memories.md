An entity's 'Memories' structure is a auditable-collection of the events experienced by the entity and the information and emotional-impact associated to the event from the entity's perspective. 

For the most part this system applies primarily to sentient entities such as individual persons or groups such as factions which can be simplified to have a 'collective' memory.

The [[Simulae Event]]s they accumulate as experiences can also be sub-classed as [[Social Event]]s by engaging in the realm of the [[Socialization]] system

> Ex: Memory structure:
```json
Memory = {
	"Experiences": {...},
	"Recipes": {...},
}
```
## Experiences 

An entity acquires experiences either by directly witnessing an [[Simulae Event]] occur or by having its details relayed to them piece by piece.

## Recipes

'Recipes' are known formulas that can be satisfied to produce an outcome. 

These can be 'crafting' recipes, requirements for rituals, etc
