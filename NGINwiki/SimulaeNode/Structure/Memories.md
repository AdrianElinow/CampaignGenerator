An entity's 'Memories' structure is a auditable-collection of the events experienced by the entity and the information and emotional-impact associated to the event from the entity's perspective. 

For the most part this system applies primarily to sentient entities such as individual persons or groups such as factions which can be simplified to have a 'collective' memory.
