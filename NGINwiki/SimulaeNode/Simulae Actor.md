Simulae Actor's are Sentient [[SimulaeNode]] entities that have agency over themselves, surroundings, and other sentient entities. 

They can interact with other sentient entities via the [[Socialization]] system, and can perform complex tasks based on their breakdown of these tasks into sequences of simpler subtasks via the [[Plan]] system
