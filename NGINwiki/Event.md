A [[Simulae]] Event is a data structure intended to represent as many types of 'events' as possible from a high abstract level to a very minute incremental time-scale

[[Event]]'s are a class derived from the [[Simulae]] base structure ([[SimulaeNode]]) which are intended to take advantage of it's flexibility while still being able to accommodate the abstract nature of representing an 'event'
