This ability specification follows [[Abilities]] and emits [[Event]] structures when its effect conditions are satisfied.

## Task ([[Task]])

- Goal State: Maintain daily executions while surviving long enough for Evil to win under persistent false-information pressure.
- Action Sequence: Use the role ability to create the board-state and social-state required by that goal.
- Task Actions: Trigger role-ability [[Event]] outputs that advance this role's victory progress while blocking opposing victory paths.
- Completion Signal: Emit/observe terminal [[Event]] evidence that confirms the goal state is achieved.
