This ability specification follows [[Abilities]] and emits [[Simulae Event]] structures when its effect conditions are satisfied.

## Task ([[Task]])

- Goal State: If the Demon is executed while Mastermind lives, force the extra-day state to resolve in Evil's favor.
- Action Sequence: Use the role ability to create the board-state and social-state required by that goal.
- Task Actions: Trigger role-ability [[Simulae Event]] outputs that advance this role's victory progress while blocking opposing victory paths.
- Completion Signal: Emit/observe terminal [[Simulae Event]] evidence that confirms the goal state is achieved.
