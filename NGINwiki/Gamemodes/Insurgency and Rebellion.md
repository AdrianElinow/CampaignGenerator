[[Insurgency and Rebellion]] is a [[Gamemode]] about covert resistance versus institutional control.

## Core Loop
1. Cells assign clandestine [[Task]]s for recruitment, sabotage, and intel.
2. Authorities issue counter-operations and surveillance plans.
3. Public sentiment and covert actions resolve through visible and hidden [[Simulae Event]] layers.
4. Momentum shifts based on legitimacy, fear, and strategic disruption.

## Simulae Fit
- Leverages secrecy, dual visibility, and social trust dynamics.
