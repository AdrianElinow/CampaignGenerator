[[Mystery Investigation]] is a [[Gamemode]] focused on clue synthesis, witness interviews, and hypothesis testing.

## Core Loop
1. Investigators collect clues and testimony through [[Simulae Event]] and [[Social Event]] evidence.
2. The system generates investigative [[Task]]s from unresolved contradictions.
3. Actors validate or falsify hypotheses by targeted actions and inquiries.
4. Case state updates when proof thresholds are met.

## Simulae Fit
- Ideal for memory-driven reasoning and explainable social inference.
