[[Expedition Crawl]] is a [[Gamemode]] about exploration, hazards, and progressive objective depth.

## Core Loop
1. Team selects route objectives and risk posture via [[Plan]].
2. Members execute exploration and support [[Task]]s per encounter.
3. Traps, combat, discoveries, and narrative beats are emitted as [[Event]] chains.
4. Expedition status updates from attrition, loot, and mission milestones.

## Simulae Fit
- Works with long-form state progression and emergent encounter resolution.
