[[Political Intrigue]] is a [[Gamemode]] focused on influence, alliances, blackmail, and narrative power shifts.

## Core Loop
1. Actors gather leverage and information through [[Social Event]] interactions.
2. NPCs propose deals, threats, and policy changes as [[Task]] offers.
3. Public and private outcomes are captured as [[Simulae Event]] records.
4. Power blocs are recalculated based on trust, legitimacy, and control.

## Simulae Fit
- Emphasizes [[Social Event]], memory, and dynamic objective negotiation.
