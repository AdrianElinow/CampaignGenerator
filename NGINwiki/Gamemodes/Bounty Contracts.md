[[Bounty Contracts]] is a [[Gamemode]] where agents accept contracts to track, capture, or eliminate targets.

## Core Loop
1. Issuers create contract [[Task]]s with explicit reward and failure clauses.
2. Hunters gather intel and track targets via social and physical [[Simulae Event]] traces.
3. Engagement outcomes update notoriety, trust, and faction response.
4. Contracts resolve into payout, escalation, or retaliation arcs.

## Simulae Fit
- Uses contract-like task structures and consequence-heavy event histories.
