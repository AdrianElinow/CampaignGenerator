[[Survival and Scarcity]] is a [[Gamemode]] centered on needs management, resource pressure, and environmental hazards.

## Core Loop
1. NPCs prioritize urgent need-based [[Task]]s (food, water, shelter, medicine).
2. Groups forage, craft, and defend using available [[Abilities]].
3. World hazards and weather resolve as continuous [[Simulae Event]] streams.
4. Settlement viability is recalculated from morale, health, and stock levels.

## Simulae Fit
- Integrates status-driven planning with world-state event feedback.
