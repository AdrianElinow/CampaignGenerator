[[Heist Operations]] is a [[Gamemode]] about planning and executing high-risk objective theft or sabotage.

## Core Loop
1. Team composes a multi-step [[Plan]] (infiltration, access, extraction).
2. Specialists receive synchronized [[Task]]s with timing constraints.
3. Security reactions and stealth failures generate branching [[Event]] outcomes.
4. Escape and reward distribution finalize success or failure state.

## Simulae Fit
- Strong dependency on conditional ability checks and cascading event causality.
