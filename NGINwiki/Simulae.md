'Simulae' is a multigenerational framework for representing any and all physical realities using a unified object-model. 

## Simulae Object Model

The Simulae object-model is the data-structure that can be used to describe or represent any physical object. This object model is codified by the [[SimulaeNode]] class

In order to be able to represent any physical object the structure is primarily a collection of lookups ('dictionaries' in the case of this implementation using Python)
